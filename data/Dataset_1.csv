J. Fikry  two friends--often in love, but never lovers--come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality. On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster,  Ichigo . Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow  is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before. Show more Genres Fiction Contemporary Romance Audiobook Literary Fiction Adult Historical Fiction ...more

Fair warning that I am predisposed to adore coming-of-age novels about protagonists of my generation (Gen X), apparently even if I don’t have much in common with them other than birth year. In this case, the protagonists are Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives intertwine up, down, and around their love of gaming. It must be said that this book is VERY MUCH about video games. Sadie and Sam play them, talk about them, design them, and promote them over the span of thirty years. What a testament to author Gabrielle Zevin’s writing that I could be glued to the pages of a story about a topic that typically bores me to tears! Because I loved Sadie and Sam so much, I never lost interest in their worlds - either the real one of their day-to-day existence or the virtual ones they were building. They are, without a doubt in my mind, the two characters I’ve cared about the most over the past decade of my reading life. I do say that with a bit of trepidation, as I know some readers of this review who love me (shout out to my mom again!) will want to read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to meet my new literary best friends. I must therefore point out that while the novel is a masterpiece in my eyes, some people are not going to be able to get through it. Zevin is a fan of obscure words, there are risky techniques used (such as an occasional second-person chapter and dropping readers into a video game world), sad and unsavory things happen in the plot, and the text is fairly dense. This is a long 416 pages. Also, having read (and enjoyed) Zevin’s previous two novels, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry and Young Jane Young, this feels like it’s from an entirely different author. I breezed through those others in a day, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow took me a week. I know that’s because I savored every word and often reread entire paragraphs, but that’s my point. If her prior books were hamburgers, this one is a steak. I feel a bit bad for the upcoming books I’ll be reading in the wake of this novel, since I know nothing will compare for a very long time. In case it’s not clear enough already, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has a well-earned place on my all-time favorites shelf. When you finish the final page of a book and hug it to your chest, where else would it go?

I've loved Zevin's books in the past and I was lured in by some of the early starred reviews that promised I would be enchanted by this book. I can see the many interesting themes the author is juggling here and have highlighted a few passages I thought were noteworthy, yet a few moments of brilliance just couldn't make this book any less tedious for me. The story is essentially about gamers and video games, throwing up constant references to the history of gaming and gaming culture. The two main characters, Sadie and Sam, bond over playing video games when the pair meet in the children's ward of a hospital and later conceive of, and program, games of their own. Their own personal stories-- involving family, friends, sexism in the industry and abusive relationships (contains emotional manipulation and sexual assault) play out alongside this. I will confess that maybe it is just my disinterest in the world of gaming that drives my apathy towards this story. I have played my fair share of certain games-- caught them all in Pokemon, explored the worlds of Final Fantasy VII onwards, built a fabulous neighbourhood in Sims, employed some questionable antics in Grand Theft Auto and, to a lesser extent, tried my hand at Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and The Last of Us. That being said, I do not consider ""gamer"" to be a defining term for me. I would always rather read. And my interest in games does not extend beyond the games to the culture surrounding it. Kirkus assured me that even those who ""have never played a video game in their lives"" will love this book, but I feel like that probably isn't true. I found it a struggle just to make it through and I kept finding excuses to check my email, google something random that occurred to me, or just do household chores instead of reading this. Some people have commented on it being a long book, but 400 pages isn't all that long. It feels much longer.

Sam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games. The narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs. Sam and Sadie are both loveable, arrogant, infuriating, and flawed. The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie’s anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view). I loved them, but I also wanted to shake some sense in them. Sam’s mother, Anna; Marx, Sam’s college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact.  My favorite characters were Sam’s grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha. The novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.  All characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Even the avatars are multidimensional. I am not a huge fan of video games, but this book made me nostalgic for the video games of my childhood. I got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn’t mind because I learned so much about gaming. The reader doesn’t need to know much about video games to enjoy this book (but it might help!).  There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world. This is a well-written, complex, thought-provoking, and original novel. I was invested in the characters, and some moments hit me on an emotional level. I got teary-eyed towards the end. I won't forget these characters; this is a book that is going to stay with me for a long time. I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

Because, as the blurb stated, this was essentially a book about two good friends making a video game together. But was it? Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure where I would land on this when I decided to pick up late via BOTM add-on. (See, I even skipped over it when it was one of the monthly picks). Despite being a child of the 80's and 90's, I never played videogames. I know, I know...the horror, some of you might be thinking. But, whelp, my dad was adamantly against us playing them, convinced it would make us lazy and turn our minds into mush. Well, while I can't say that I'm not  lazy or that my mind isn't  mush despite never being a gamer, I can  say that, based on the one or two times I played it at a friends' house, I really  sucked at Mario Kart  anyway. But I digress. Like I said, never having been a gamer, I was worried about how that might play into my enjoyment of a book which, on the surface, was centered around video games. But again...was it really? Yes and no. This was about so much more than video games, folks. So much more than standard friendship. I can't even explain what I mean here...It just encapsulated so much of the human experience in such a bold, yet nuanced way. In today's western culture--which is seemingly insistent upon everything  having to be a social justice/political statement that slams you over the head on exhausting repeat--the way this book handled said topics felt...organic. Showing not telling. Allowing me to absorb  the message instead of simply beating me over the head with self-righteousness. So refreshing. Also, there are so many elements of the book that felt personal to me...that struck a chord with me. I won't get into them; but, suffice to say that, again, this book was very much about the human experience. And the way the author used video games as a platform for it all was super creative. And super well executed, in my opinion. Originally, I rated this 4.5 instead of 5 stars; however, I've thought about this book a lot since finishing it several days ago. And anything that makes me self-reflect...that moves me enough to contemplate the facets of it days later...deserves the full five. P.S. You don't need to be a gamer to love this book. P.P.S. You do need to love Marx.

Sam, whose foot has been crushed in a car accident, hasn't spoken to anyone for months but meeting Sadie, and playing video games with her, brings Sam alive, pulls him out of his pain and heartbreak. That friendship lasts for a while until one of them feels betrayed and then it's over. Eight years later an accidental meeting has them back together. Their love of gaming, their ability to create games, leads to collaboration and the making of games. They are successes at game making but that success pulls them apart again. While the playing field can be even for everyone when they start a video game, giving everyone the same chance to build and conquer, the real world sees everyone differently. One gets more credit than the other, resentments and misunderstandings grow. Even when working together, Sam and Sadie are apart in the most hurtful ways. This is the story of Sam and Sadie but Marx is a part of that story. Marx, who plays games but doesn't make games, becomes a crucial part of Sam and Sadie's company and their lives. Marx is the best friend a person could have, he's the best partner a person could have, he's the mediator when it's needed, he's the glue that holds things together. He's the person Sam tries to imitate when he doesn't know how to go on. This story contains three decades worth of brilliance, creativity, friendship, love, romance. jealousy, resentment, isolation, miscommunication, and more. Maybe some huge successes require people to be somewhat broken and misunderstood. Definitely love does not have to be romantic to last a lifetime. When it comes to Sam and Sadie, it's taken them years and years but I do think they finally mature in the end and there is something to be said for a maturity that might allow estranged people to come back together. There is lots of talk about creating and making games and playing games. Sometimes we are in a game. I loved all of that. I understand gaming and I can get lost in the worlds that allow us to forget our real world. Worlds that allow more than one life, dying doesn't have to mean death, you have more chances to go on or start over. All of that is so interesting to me and I laughed whenever the word dysentery was mentioned. But this story really got to me because there is a lot of sadness, isolation (something gaming can even cause), and anger. I wanted everyone to be able to be a Marx. But that's not how the world works, not everyone can be a Marx, life is not that easy for everyone. I'll be thinking about this story for a long time and will probably see it differently as time goes on. It will take me a while to get over this story, I'll need time to let it just settle in my mind.

I am not a gamer myself, so if you are not either, do not let this put you off, because this is essentially about the all too human aspects and the complexities of what it is to be human, the connections made through this medium, such as the relationships, the friendships and the joyful delight to be found in a perfect digital world, a sharp contrast to the problems and difficulties that are to found in the more messy real world. Sam and Sadie first meet fortuitously in the late 1980s as children in a hospital, finding common ground in playing games, like Super Mario, competitively. Memories comes flooding back when they meet again years later at a rail station as we follow their lives evolving through the decades, as they begin to create games together, setting up in business together, the creative input balanced by the grounding and practical presence of Marx. They do extremely well which brings all the pressures and trappings associated with success. The characters are vivid, distinct and from diverse backgrounds, in a narrative that touches on a wide variety of issues and themes that resonate, like identity, love, loss, family, technology, race, disability, betrayal and inevitable failures, and what is important in life. We are given a insightful glimpse into the gaming industry, its history and business side, and how gaming can help people endure hard times through the escapism it offers. A brilliant and imaginative read that I think will appeal to many readers. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.

Some of the details of designing, coding and playing video games were tedious for me to read. However, when I tried to get into another book – the characters of THIS BOOK kept calling me back. From 30% on I was invested and fell in love with Sadie, Sam and Marx. It’s important to note that this book covers several decades so it’s hard to describe all that happens with these characters!! Sam and Sadie meet in a hospital. Sadie is there to visit her sister, who is undergoing cancer treatment, and Sam is a patient. He was in a horrific car accident and his foot has been repaired but it will never be normal!! He will be in constant pain!! Sadie and Sam bond over their love of video games, mazes, etc. “They had the rare kind of friendship that allowed for a great deal of privacy within it.” There is a point where Sadie and Sam don’t see each other for years but when they are back together the magic is still there. Ideas are worked out together, code is written, Marx is the producer and promoter and for a long time all is good. As with all human relationships that span decades, these three will go through many changes, and it’s wonderful to watch how they grow. All the emotions are here, friendship, love, happiness, grief, depression, exuberance – all so well described that I felt it with them!! The writing in this book is absolutely wonderful. I love this quote from Marx “What is a game? Marx said. “It’s tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption”. I already miss these characters so much! I would encourage you to give this novel a try, even if you’ve never played a video game in your life!!!

Lots of Catching up to do 385 reviews 545 followers Follow Follow February 6, 2023 A tale of friendship, a lesson in love and a perpetual game of life with its infinite number of second chances, lost opportunities and endless possibilities. And at the centre - love and friendship of course. “What is a game?"" Marx said. ""It's tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It's the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.” The Plot A chance meeting at a hospital is to connect the lives of Sadie and Sam through video gaming and home entertainment. A relationship that is tested, grows, changes, and suffers from many of the obstacles life creates - love, greed, misunderstanding, vanity, discrimination, domestic violence, abuse, death and many more. However, the constant in their lives is the love and ambition for inventing and playing video games. Yet, like many winning partnerships, their loyalty is tested when fame and success enters their lives and the two struggle with each other, despite the intervention of their loyal friend Marx. While the book includes many side stories and sub plots, the core to this book is the relationship between Sadie, Sam and also Marx with some important themes for the reader to reflect on. There is a sad moment in the book that will play on my mind tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!! But I will not spoil here. Review and Comments It was all about the writing style and relationships for me that took the meaning of gaming to a whole new level. The characters felt so real and genuine which came through in the writing and turned a seemingly ordinary plot into something extraordinary. My favourite character was Marx although the two characters at the centre of the story were well developed and had such redeeming and less desirable qualities which I loved because this felt ‘real’. There are a few elements to the story that did not work so well for me. For example, using the title and references from Shakespeare’s Macbeth (and others) “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” implied there was going to be a connection and relevance to the gaming world. The sense of infinity yes but some of the Shakespeare quotes peppered throughout just didn’t work and at times it felt awkward. Only an opinion. I also believe that my reading experience would have been marginally better had I been more familiar with the gaming jargon. So, I decided to set that aside and focus on the relationships at the centre of the story and only then did the book make sense to me. A modern take on some timeless themes. A story of reinvention, infinity, and the possibility of a different life, but also a stark reminder that life is complicated, complex, painful and sometimes intolerable but it is also what we make of it. Despite the distractions and when the game of life becomes the cruelty of life, it is up to the individual to decide on the appropriate course of action, because after all there are no rules and no winners. Just love and friendship made better through willingness and forgiveness. The focus on relationships was superb but I particularly loved the reinvention of Sadie and Sam’s relationship and the quote that says it all… “The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.” I loved that “Love is both constant and variable”. True of many relationships. Overall an excellent book, there is no doubt that this book will continue to be enjoyed by many tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!!.

Absolutely one my year’s favorite!!!!  “The most successful people are also the most able to change their mindsets”. But….Not easy, huh? I’m back… I loved everything about this book… It’s adorable, sweet, sad, theatrical, character-collaborative-driven-in-spirit, artful, smart, emotional, intellectually rigorous, perceptive, and wonderful… I could name a dozen more vertiginously exciting . . . vibrant words to reflect the deep satisfying experience this novel is. Even at oddball moments, Gabrielle Zevin’s novel flourishes surprising wisdom touching on the most common elements of the heart…..with unforgettable indelible characters. In totality…….IT’S ALL BRILLIANT!…..and VERY ENJOYABLE!!!  ….the writing, narrative, structure, (the gaming), the characters: (major and minor), and their relationships are LOVABLE as can be…. Sadie (Jewish-American) was one of the most brilliant people that Sam (American, part Korean and part Jewish descent) knew. He hadn’t seen her in years—until he did—since their childhood in Southern California. Sadie went to MIT Sam went to Harvard…..[Sam’s roommate-Marx- is a crucial part of the story, too]… Other favorite characters are *grandparents*… GOTTA LOVE the generations — of love…. The context themes of love, loss, and life tragedies, are captured with sincerity, depth, and honesty. This book could only have been written by somebody who has experienced grief to great lengths. Zevin has an impressive imagination and proficient talent…..leaving us readers with a memorable feat of storytelling, fine prose, and heartbreaking real characters. I was one of those readers who fell in love with her novel “The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry”…..(It wasn’t too ‘sappy’ for me as it was for a few of my friends), but THIS….”Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow”…..is more sophisticated….more fully developed…. Zevin is in her prime with this novel….  ……I can’t imagine any reader ‘disliking’ it….. There is something for everyone….many issues to contemplate!!!!  …..an examination of very profound friendships— The ‘relationship-complex-love-friendship-issues’ were masterfully explored. The brilliance shines throughout……  ….with a look at the effects of tragedies, violence, illness, death, parents, grandparents, feelings of loneliness, fitting in, admiration for gaming designers….(especially women in the profession)…love for people, love for one another, and an enhanced respect for the benefits of gaming …… About the aspects of ‘gaming’ ….  …..NOBODY NEEDS TO BE DIRECTLY interested…. But……I realized by the end of this novel (after tearful melancholy feelings), that there are benefits from gaming…. They ‘really’ must improved cognitive abilities, improved problem-solving skills and logic…. BECAUSE….  …..the characters in this novel (who played and created these games) WERE able to apply their technical skills to their relationships. It was subtle—but not-not unnoticed. So…..parents: I wouldn’t worry if you can’t get your kid to stop playing games too much. It’s amazing how much they are learning about life….in relationship to others. One more thing I must say …..then I’ll leave a few excerpts… I thought the very beginning was MASTERFULLY written. I can’t remember ever reading a book that pointed to the ‘past, present, and the future’ at the same time more magnificently. SO WELL DONE!!! Ok….enough of my excitement…. Here are some excerpts:  “Before Mazer invented himself as Mazer, he was Samson Mazer, and before he was Samson Mazer, he was Samson Mazur—a change of two letters that transformed him from a nice ostensibly jewish boy to a Professional Builder of Worlds— and for most of his youth he was Sam—S.A.M. on the hall of fame of his grandfather’s ‘Donkey Kong’ machine, but mainly Sam”. NOTE: the above excerpt— written at the start- is worth reading a few times. (IMO)….then let it go…..it will show up in different ways through the rest of the novel.  “Sadie! SADIE! He felt foolish. SADIE MIRANDA GREEN! YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!”  “Finally, she turned. She scanned the crowd slowly and when she spotted Sam, the smile spread over her face like a time-lapse video he had once seen in a high school physics class of a rose in bloom. It was beautiful, Sam thought, and perhaps, he worried, a tad ersatz. She walked over to him, still smiling—one dimple on her right cheek, an almost imperceptibly wider gap between the two middle teeth on top—and he thought that the crowd seemed to part for her, in a way that the world never moved for him”.  “It’s my sister who died of dysentery, Sam Masur, Sadie said. I died of exhaustion, following a snakebite”.  “And of not wanting to shoot the bison, Sam said”.  “It’s wasteful. All that meat just rots”.  “Sadie through her arms around him. Sam Masur! I kept hoping I’d run into you”.  “What brings you to Harvard Square? Sam asked”.  “Why the Magic Eye, of course, she said playfully. She gestured in front of her, toward the advertisement. For the first time, Sam registered the 60-by-40-inch poster that transformed commuters into zombie horde”.  “SEE THE WORLD IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. THIS CHRISTMAS, THE GIFT EVERYONE WANTS IS THE MAGIC EYE”. Sadie….with those heterochromic eyes…..  “In which case, the only proper thing for us to do right now is have coffee, Sam said. Or whatever you drink, if coffee’s too much of a cliché for you. Chai tea. Matcha. Snapple. Champagne. There’s a world with infinite beverage possibilities, right over our heads, you know? All we have to do is ride that escalator and it’s hours for the partaking”.  “If this were a game, he could hit pause. He could restart, say different things, the right one’s this time. He could search his inventory for the item that would make Sadie not leave”.  “You would think women would want to stick together when there weren’t many of them, but they never did. It was as if being a woman was a disease that you didn’t wish to catch. As long as you didn’t associate with the other women, you could imply to the majority, the men: ‘I’m not like those other ones’. Sadie was, by nature, a loner, but even she found going to MIT in a female body to be an isolating experience. The year Sadie was admitted to MIT, women were slightly over a third of her class, but somehow, it felt like even less than that. Sadie sometimes felt as if she could go weeks without seeing a woman. It might have been that the men, most of them at least, assumed you were stupid if you were a woman”. “What is a game? … It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.

It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time."" occasionally, i would read a book that leaves me speechless, unable to grasp my emotions. this is one of those times. i won't give a summary of  Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow  because i am incapable of doing it even if i want to. in my opinion, the synopsis doesn't do it justice, either. the best way to understand this book is to experience it yourself. this is a tragedy intertwined with a love story, but not any love story. i went into this expecting to read something like Alone With You in the Ether , and i closed this book knowing that no story resembles this one.  Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow  is an incredible tour de force. to write something as meta as the process of making video games with a lyrism this profound is no easy task. Zevin's descriptions of the process, so technical, transport the reader into an imaginary world so vast that at one point, i saw myself in the game sam and sadie made. additionally, i salute the author's courage to include difficult literary techniques (e.g.: second-person pov) in an already intricate setting. ultimately, the brilliance of this book comes from its characters. i don't think i have cared for characters this deeply since Alone With You in the Ether . sam, sadie, and marx are written with depth and empathy. they evolve like real people would, for better and worse. their humanity shines through the tragedies, pulling me into their suffering: that's how i know that characterization can only go so far. this is what differentiates unpleasantly brilliant books from mediocre but entertaining ones. and god, the intimacy between the three characters. there is something about the chemistry, the interactions, and their thoughts that made me wonder: can love can be greater than this? in the end, i know that this book is absolutely not for everyone, and not everyone who loved and hated this will feel the same emotions throughout the experience. for now, i leave this book at 4.5 (it will change eventually) but  Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow  will stay in my mind and my heart for a long time. -------------------------- pre-review: this book induces in me such profound grief, that i am feeling physically unwell. rtc once i recover Show more 234 likes 6 comments Like  Comment Sophie 159 reviews 103 followers Follow Follow December 22, 2022 Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't particularly enthralled. A lack of concentration plagues Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, a novel I found to be lacking. The narrative jumps from the present to various points in the past without providing the reader with an opportunity to get emotionally invested in any of the protagonists, except maybe Marx. In general, the overall writing was pleasant. Particularly interesting to me was the genuineness of the content concerning game design and production. Unfortunately, as someone who has spent a large portion of their adult life working in the gaming industry, I found the protagonists' talks of game design and development outside the scope of their debut game Ichigo to be tedious. The story was dull and I found the author's constant urge to stay woke to be obnoxious. While I respect her intention to raise awareness about pressing social concerns, I found that her preachiness frequently derailed the narrative and detracted from the plot. I find it fascinating when authors of fiction skillfully weave explorations of societal concerns into the fabric of their narratives. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Zenin did not carry out this action. Finally, while the first half of the book is interesting and well written, the second half falls apart under the weight of its own ambitions. Should you still read it? Probably based on all the other reviews. Rating: 3 Follow me on Instagram!

I loved this book so much because it's about friendship and all of its ups and downs, and yet it is very unique because it's set in the world of gaming. You don't necessarily need to be a gamer or have gaming knowledge to appreciate this book, but it does help if you have some appreciation for it. This is the story of Sadie and Sam who met in a hospital as children. Sam was there recovering from a horrible car accident, and Sadie's sister was undergoing cancer treatment. The two met playing video games together and forged a friendship, which grew and stalled many times over the years. They would go on to create a gaming company and many games together, but the underlying factors in their life and friendship ebbed and flowed continuously. This is an immersive book, full of human actions and interactions. I went from liking Sadie to not liking her and then back again, and the same with Sam. I could understand them sometimes and others I didn't. There are portions of this book that will truly break your heart, because they broke mine and caused me to dissolve into tears. Yet in the end, what are we without each other? And that's what this book communicates best. There are a few slower parts, which is why I didn't round up to 5 stars. It took me a lot longer than it should have to get through this book. But the writing is superb and Zevin really knows how to tell a great story when you get right down to it, so this is a wonderful book definitely worth reading. I look forward to see what she comes up with next. I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.

I would have if the beginning hadn’t been so beautifully done. There’s a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that’s how this book feels after the incredible start. The beginning was layered, nuanced and artfully done. I hate flashbacks but this book had managed to layer the present, past and future in such an incredible way before it fell off a cliff and suddenly feels like an entirely different writer took over. The story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. We found out about them in a narrative that skipped around in time to let us understand them and their relationship. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He’s just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don’t need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There’s plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way. One of the author’s worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play.

It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win, no loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.” Gabrielle Zevin is a Literary Gamer, defined in the NYT review as “someone for whom reading and playing are, and always have been, the same voyage.” Thus, Zevin chose to write a story about one of her joys, gaming. I’m a mother of a gamer. I never understood the passion of my son. I never understood gaming nor why it becomes an obsession. Who better than a favored author to enlighten me? And enlighten me she did! The games that the three main characters play are known to me because they were games my son played: Super Mario Bros, Sims, The Oregon Trail etc. Most of his money earned was spent on these games. I felt it was unhealthy and alarming. We needed to go so far as to cut the electricity in the computer room at night. The advent of laptops killed us as parents. Gaming was a mystery to me, until now. Zevin loosely provides the history of the gaming industry through her three characters. Sam and Sadie meet by coincidence at a Los Angeles hospital. Sam is recovering from a serious auto accident. Sadie is there visiting her sister who has cancer. The two, who are both 11, meet playing Super Mario Brothers in the children’s ward rec room. As a result of a misunderstanding, the two part on poor terms. Sam sees Sadie in a Cambridge Massachusetts train station when they are of university age. Sam goes to MIT and Sadie goes to Harvard. They decide to collaborate on a game. Marx is Sam’s roommate, a theater major. Marx becomes involved in the enterprise because both Sam and Sadie are techs and need a business manager. This is a story of brilliant artists who create something big and exceptional. It a story of a friendship and love. It’s a journey of three innovative artists and their struggles. Zevin adds cultural depth in making Sam and Marx mixed-race Asian Americans. Their racial ambiguity was especially difficult in the 1990’s and early 2000’s. The pains of the creative process is felt in the story. Who contributed the best part? Who’s getting all the credit? Fame and money become the trio’s downfall. This isn’t a story of game development. This is a story of friends and their personal life with snippets of the work and emotions involved in creating a computer game. I enjoyed every word of this novel. It’s beautifully written. I was captivated in their gaming world and their personal lives. Sadie and Sam are geniuses who are personally self-destructive. Marx is the guy who can sooth ruffled feathers. It’s a friendship story, a love story, and a bit of the gaming world. Thank you Gabrielle Zevin! I think I sort of understand my son’s obsession with his alternative universe. I do like the idea that if you die, you can restart your game.

A brilliant coming of age masterpiece, spanning almost 30 years. An epic tale of friendship, love, art, video games, and the journey of life. As a teen, I played my fair share of Sonic, Mario Brothers, etc, but nothing with the intensity of this book, realistic games that blur reality and fantasy. I was immersed. The simple fact that Gabrielle Zevin weaved a layered story, carefully crafting characters within the backdrop of gaming and was able to peak my interest, speaks to the beauty of her writing. This is the story of Sam and Sadie, Sam and Marx, Sadie and Marx, and their journey building a successful gaming company. Sam and Sadie meet in the most unexpected places-a hospital. Sadie's sister is undergoing cancer treatment, while Sam, is recovering from a major injury that leaves him disabled. Sam and Sadie connect over their love for games. Sadie becomes an integral piece of Sam's life and his recovery. Time moves forward, Sam and Marx are roommates at Harvard. Marx is an aspiring actor while Sam pursues his passion for making games. One day, Sam happens to meet Sadie on campus (she's there for a gaming meeting) and they connect (over Oregon Trail of all things). Sadie gives Sam a game she's working on, and the rest--a story of creating amazing, creative games together. Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow (an ode to MacBeth, which later, ties beautifully into one of the characters arcs) is the story of missed opportunities, successes, pains, love, and creating art. There is a time for any fledgling artist where one’s taste exceeds one’s abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anyway Zevin not only created amazing virtual worlds, I'd love to play, she wrote an entire chapter within a game, that was literary genius. There was also a chapter in second person, which may feel out of place to some, but made sense in the context of the character's journey. Initially, I was bogged down by all the gaming conversations, but it's worth it to continue reading. The beginning ties in wonderfully as we learn the struggles of creating true art. Zevin also touches upon some important cultural/political topics that helped move the story along. The truth is, I cried and cheered for these wonderfully written characters that felt like friends more than fictional souls. I recently read, 'The Storied Life of A.J. Fikery,' and became an instant fan of Zevin. It feels remarkably coincidental that her new book came right after--alas, the stars aligned. I savored Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, felt protective of the words, and had a sense of reverence to the story. Have you ever felt a physical reaction after finishing a book? I was in a melancholy state, like I wanted to be transported into the pages, stilling time.  How could a person still be as young as he objectively knew himself to be and have had so much time pass? As I closed the last page, my daughter wanted to be tucked into bed, yet I wanted to snuggle up with the book and fall asleep. Sometimes, after finishing a book, it’s hard to let go, say goodbye. There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen. And sometimes, this other life felt as palpable as the one you were living.  5 spectacular stars!

I know I'm in the minority, but I do not need to be emotionally and traumatically destroyed while reading. The prose was pretentious and unnecessary. Both characters are rather insufferable, immature, and showed no growth. For a book supposedly celebrating friendship, this was the definition of a TOXIC, unhealthy platonic relationship between male  female. I'm honestly not sure what the moral of the story was? Other than let's make sure to include every single controversial issue possible and make our stance known.

But somehow I loved this unique novel that is titled after Macbeth’s soliloquy and is about friends who form a video game company while they are in college. Sam Masur and Sadie Green met when they were 11 and 10 years old at a Los Angeles hospital. Sam is there due to a tragic car accident that damaged his foot. Sadie is there because her older sister has cancer. These two incredibly brilliant children spend over 600 hours together, bonding over their love of video games. After an argument occurs, they do not speak for six years until they run into each other in Boston. Sam is a student at Harvard and Sadie is at MIT, when Sam convinces Sadie that they should build a video game together. Sam’s wealthy roommate, Marx, agrees to let them use his apartment over the summer to do the work. In exchange, Marx is made a producer. The game is an overnight success, plunging these three young adults into business together. Sam and Sadie love each other as friends but have great difficulty getting along. They again go through years of not speaking to each other. Marx is always the peace-maker, holding the business together. This is a character-driven story about friendship, love, work, and finding balance in life. Sam, Sadie, and Marx will stay in my heart for a long time. 5-Stars.

That being said, this is not just a book for people who love to game. This is also a book for people who are looking for an epic read. “There is an order to any victory. There is an optimal way to play any game.” Isn’t that as true in life as it is in gaming? Aren’t we all trying to play our best ‘game’ to get to that pot of gold, whatever it may be? This is what lies at the core of this story; the chance encounters we have on our journey. Some people whom we meet along the way might turn into lifelong influencers and will travel with us. There are always going to be a few key players in our game of life who will change our path for better and worse. We don’t know how any of these characters will fit into our ending narrative until the game is done, but we must play. Gabrielle Zevin’s prose is absolutely divine. Her tremendous talent for world-building and rich character development had me hooked from the beginning. I was emotionally wrung out by the end of this book but with a smile on my heart. I don’t want to give away too much, but I hope you don’t pass on this one just because of the quirky cover. Behind it is a world that will leave a lasting impression.

Starting with what I enjoyed about the book, I found the prose so readable. Gabrielle Zevin has a knack for telling a good story and about 100 pages in, I felt immersed in her characters’ lives in a way that only some of the best writers can execute. There’s a slice-of-life quality to the storytelling in Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow  that helped me feel like I was gliding along with Sam, Sadie, and Marx’s lives from their college years to their early and then approaching mid-adulthood. The video game aspect of the story actually made sense to me and added a quirky touch to the novel that didn’t come across as gimmicky. I also liked the integration of social commentary in this book through the characters’ lives. I felt a lot for Sam and his struggle with his disability and Sadie with her experiences of sexism in the video game industry and in life generally. Zevin does a nice job of showing and not telling so that these elements of social justice/injustice felt organic instead of too obvious or preachy. I think my biggest critique of this book centers on Sam and Sadie’s friendship. I will couch this commentary by saying that I read a lot of literary fiction and it’s one of my favorite genres so my expectations are reasonably high. I found their friendship engaging, though at the same time I don’t think Zevin developed the foundation of their friendship enough to merit all of the conflict and turmoil they experienced. For example, Sam consistently idealizes Sadie throughout the book and is all “I love Sadie Green even though I can’t tell her” and I was like uh why?? Like I get that they had a somewhat intense bonding experience as kids and then they made video games together, but I literally had no clue why Sam actually loved Sadie – she treats him pretty horribly throughout the book as he does to her at times. I get that friends can treat each other poorly, though I struggled to believe Sam and Sadie’s bond given that they get into these intense arguments all the time and then resolve them by… forgetting and forgiving instead of communicating through the conflict and processing what actually happened?? Idk, maybe my best friendships are so healthy to the point where it feels a bit incomprehensible to me (shout-out to Bri  one of my bestianas who’s also on Goodreads!) As a side note, I think I’m spoiled because I read Jhumpa Lahiri’s The Lowland  and Unaccustomed Earth  earlier this year and late last year respectively, and she sets the bar so high in terms of characters with rich inner lives that then manifest in their interpersonal relationships. Hanya Yanagihara pulled this off too in A Little Life , though I don’t recommend her other books lol. I also felt frustrated by the overall treatment of friendship in this novel. For the first 60% or so, there’s this implicit and explicit theme of friendship being important and special and not inferior to romance. However, this deteriorates when certain events happen later on in the book. Like, at the very end, Sam literally says that he felt insecure that Sadie didn’t want to be with him romantically/physically because of his disability, his Asianness, his lack of wealth… which implies that he actually wanted a romantic relationship with her all along… which undercuts the importance of friendship. Yikes  Like, Sadie is a white woman from a wealthy background, why did Sam feel so entranced by her?? Idk, it reminds me a bit too much of Asian men who are obsessed with white women’s approval and being attractive to white women instead of loving themselves (like this tweet  depicts). And I don’t think Zevin sufficiently showed an arc of Sam learning to love himself, even if imperfectly, which would have been my preference even if it’s not everyone’s. Anyway, as you can tell this book was engaging enough that it elicited this long of a review from me. Again, I was entertained and immersed so I can see why so many people hyped this book. Not my favorite though a story with interesting elements and relevant social commentary for sure.

What do I have in common with two young gamers? But I was drawn into this story of friendship. Zevin has a real knack for creating characters and making you see them as real people. In just a few words, she can focus in one someone’s nature. Sam Masur and Sadie Green are friends and partners, game designers. But they each have their own issues and they don’t always have each other’s best interests at heart. The story mostly alternates between their two POVs, which helps the reader see both sides of their relationship. At times, both come across as insecure and immature. But they always came across as real. The writing here is spectacular and the scenes grabbed me. For the first time, I really understood phantom limb pain. I’m not a gamer, but I could totally get into how the games were created and the depth of thought that went into them. This is a book that will appeal to all readers, not just the young or the gamers. It’s not a fast or necessarily an easy read. It’s layered and complex. It speaks to all types of love and grief, about the ability to start over, for multiple chances. The one part of the book which didn’t work for me was Pioneers, which evokes playing a game. I felt this section could have been compressed. But bear in mind, I don’t play video games, so maybe it will work better for others.

I’ve played different games off and on over the years – first, with my brother back when the Atari and original Nintendo were all the rage, and, more recently, with my two boys whenever they need Mom’s help to clear a level or beat a boss. My greatest claim to fame, though, is that I’ve even gone so far as to conquer both Paper Mario: Color Splash  and Super Mario Odyssey . Impressive, huh? Hardcore gamers would probably say: not so much . I, however, am quite proud of my modest video game accomplishments. But aside from playing a game from time to time, this is where my interest in the subject ends. Video game design – the process and technicalities of it – is not what I want to read about in a novel. Enter Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow , Gabrielle Zevin’s beloved 2022 release. It’s been on my shelf since before it even published, but I’ve put off reading it because it’s about video games. Sadie and Sam, Zevin’s two protagonists, are game designers, and Tomorrow  is the story of their 30-year friendship, forged as children by their mutual desire to play and create games together. What a mistake I made by putting off this spectacular novel. Tomorrow  is a special sort of read, one that doesn’t come around often. The story, the characters, and Zevin’s brilliant writing is a big, beautiful gut punch to the soul. You feel the book in your bones. I fell in love with Sadie and Sam. (Marx, too. And I suppose Dov, but only a little bit.) I fell in love with the games they created. And I fell in love with their friendship, the highs and the lows of it. Sadie and Sam may very well be one of the greatest love stories ever told. Do not miss it.

There is a specific kind of sentimentality or emotion that just does not work for me at all, but that a lot of people find extremely compelling. It is a matter of personal taste, it is not really about whether a book is inherently good or bad. You either like a book that will purposely tug at your heartstrings or you don't. I don't, ergo this book was not for me. The thing is, that I liked the first half of this book pretty well. I enjoyed the way we see Sam and Sadie, who became friends through playing video games as kids, and the way they come together and then break apart. I liked seeing how their grudges and resentments could trickle in to cause problems, and then it could all be erased through their joy of gaming together. About halfway through this book I started to get suspicious. I had a feeling that we were being set up for something. That the stakes were being purposely heightened. I did not like it! I kept seeing danger around every turn when that was not what kind of book this was. Until, well, I ended up being right after all. I did not like the last half at all. It felt manipulative and bordering on maudlin. It didn't feel like it really earned what it was going for. Also, slight spoiler thoughts behind a tag, Marx is just not a real person! He has no flaws, apparently, besides sleeping around in his early 20's. He is handsome and charming and loyal and apparently good at everything? I never bought his relationship with Sadie and it felt contrived just to give Sadie something to grieve. He is basically an ex machina to make everything happen in the book, it got very annoying. I do not think you need to be a gamer at all to read this book. I'm not and I was able to be invested in everything along the way. Zevin is deft at explaining what makes a game compelling without boring anyone. Ultimately this is a book about friendship that just happens to be set around video games. There were lots of little things that irked me along the way (I will be so happy if I never read another book where a character attends Harvard) particularly Dov's character, who is a pretty terrible person but that everyone decides is just fine because all that happened so long ago, right? It was pretty weird, especially since he treats the only major female character so badly. But there were also lots of little things that I enjoyed, little threads that Zevin would drop and then pick up again (secret highways, the history of Sam's mother, etc.). I just wanted to read a perfectly boring book about Sam and Sadie working together, the highs and lows of their friendship. (In a lot of ways this is similar to a bottle episode of Mythic Quest that I liked a lot, though this had the potential to be better because it was based on friendship more than romance.) But I suspect this book's target audience isn't interested in that and they are here to have their heartstrings pulled. If that is you, there is a lot here that I think you'll like. And the video game elements really serve to distinguish it from the pack. I did the audio version of this book, the reader had actually also read another book I'd read just a few days earlier. I like her style, which she does adjust to the material, but is more of a flat reading than an overly emotional one. I think it suits, balancing out some of the elements in the book. She also has to do a lot of accents, which she manages quite well.
